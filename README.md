# NewTics_analysis

The idea is to have *all* software produced in the lab and used in this project be placed here automatically through synchronization with GitHub. Includes Python, R, shell scripts, and any home-grown compiled software.

You can use GitHub directly if that's more intuitive (https://github.com/KBMD/NewTics_analysis).
